     but in this doc new 100 boxes is created one upon another so it means inside the html 100 div elemnts are created for every 2 sec sometimes it can Hang bcz of overload.

  6th:  MAIN file .
      By clearing the previous result in every 2 sec it creates fresh new set of 100 boxes with random size, random shape, random position and random color for each box automatically.
      it looks fun...
